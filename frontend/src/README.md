# Project Description + Instructions to Run / Setup

<br>This project was about setting up a business supply system that allows the user to view tables in our business supply system and work with the stored procedures to allow the user to interact with the system.

To set up the project, users must download all files and the database script containing the stored procedures, views, and data.

To run the project, users must have React and Node.js installed on their systems.

1. Start up the backend of the server :
  	* Open up the folder containing the files<br>
  	* Using a terminal change directory to backend using cd backend.<br>
  	* Then input node server.js into the terminal to start the server<br>
2. Start up the frontend of the server:<br>
    * Using the terminal navigate back to the folder using cd ..<br>
    * Then change the directory to frontend using cd frontend.<br>
    * Then input npm start to start the locally hosted page.<br>
## Tech Used

<br>Frontend : ReactJS - Used to develop the locally-hosted webpages<br>
<br>Backend : Node.js / Express.js - Used to connect to the database in MySQL and call on the stored functions, procedures, and views to be used by the user in the front end.<br>
<br>Database : MySQL - Database with all stored procedures, views, and tables<br>
## Work Distribution

<br>Everyone was responsible for their section of the database according to the project scenario use case in Phase III

<br>Leo Zheng - Responsible for sections 4 and 8 in the database. Engineered the frontend / backend development to deal with stored procedures.
<br>Andy Vo - Responsible for sections 1 and 5 in the database. Implemented page navigation and routing in ReactJS.
<br>Kelly Zhang - Responsible for section 2 and 6 in the database. Designed the front-end components and table data display
<br>Andrew Jiang - Responsible for section 3 and 7 in the database. Polished and tested MySQL Queries to ensure full accuracy on the autograder and tested through possible inputs to fine-tune code.

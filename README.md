# Phase4
Project Description + Instructions to Run / Setup
This project was about setting up a business supply system that allows the user to view tables in
our business supply system and work with the stored procedures to allow the user to interact with
the system.

To set up the project, users must download all files and the database script containing the stored
procedures, views, and data.

To run the project, users must have React and Node.js installed on their systems.
1. Start up the backend of the server :
   a. Open up the folder containing the files
   b. Using a terminal change directory to backend using cd backend.
   c. Then input node server.js into the terminal to start the server
2. Start up the frontend of the server:
   a. Using the terminal navigate back to the folder using cd ..
   b. Then change the directory to frontend using cd frontend.
   c. Then input npm start to start the locally hosted page.

Technologies Used
1. Frontend : ReactJS - Used to develop the locally-hosted webpages
2. Backend : Node.js / Express.js - Used to connect to the database in MySQL and call on the stored functions, procedures, and views to be used by the user in the front end.
3. Database : MySQL - Database with all stored procedures, views, and tables
   
Work Distribution
Everyone was responsible for their section of the database according to the project scenario
use case in Phase III

backend development to deal with stored procedures.
Andy Vo - Responsible for sections 1 and 5 in the database. Implemented page
navigation and routing in ReactJS.
Kelly Zhang - Responsible for section 2 and 6 in the database. Designed the front-end
components and table data display
Andrew Jiang - Responsible for section 3 and 7 in the database. Polished and tested
MySQL Queries to ensure full accuracy on the autograder and tested through possible
inputs to fine-tune code.
